## Edward Abbey

### _The Brave Cowboy_, 1956

Page 14:
> The black rock was sharp-edged, hot, and hard as corundum; it seemed not
> merely alien but impervious to life. Yet on the southern face of almost every
> rock the lichens grew, yellow, rusty-brown, yellow-green, like patches of
> dirty paint daubed on the stone.
