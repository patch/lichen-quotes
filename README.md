## Edward Abbey

### _The Brave Cowboy_, 1956

#### The Cowboy

> The black rock was sharp-edged, hot, and hard as corundum; it seemed not
> merely alien but impervious to life. Yet on the southern face of almost every
> rock the lichens grew, yellow, rusty-brown, yellow-green, like patches of
> dirty paint daubed on the stone.

### _Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness_, 1968

#### Down the River

> Here the canyon walls are a little wider, permitting the sun, for perhaps a
> couple of hours during the summer day, to shine directly down into this
> cul-de-sac. A rivulet of clear water pours into the pool; glints and flecks of
> light reflected from its agitated surface dance over the dark-golden walls of
> the glen. Lichens are growing there, green, red, orange, and along the seep
> line are beds of poison ivy, scarlet monkeyflower, maidenhair fern, death
> camas, helleborine orchid and small pale yellow columbines. There are no trees
> or shrubs, for the sunlight is too brief.

#### Tukuhnikivats
> I stand on broken rock, slabs of granite veined with feldspar and quartz,
> colored with patches of green and auburn lichens.

### _Black Sun_, 1971

#### In the Sun

> They walked over the gray rock daubed with green, red, yellow, rust-brown
> lichens, past the twisted and silvery skeletons of long-dead trees, and along
> an icy cornice of snow which overhung the inner basin. Down in there, among
> the rock slides, snow fields and pinnacles, were islands of forest, and
> springs and running streams, deer and columbines and purple fields of lupine
> and larkspur. Above them was only the sun, the solitary star in a burning
> wine-dark sky.

---

> And then, fighting the wind, like forcing a way through an invisible wall,
> they descended the ridge beyond, where there was no trail, and entered the
> inner basin of the mountain. Free of the wind, they picked their way down a
> talus of loose rock between towering extrusions of ancient lava—shapes like
> gargoyles, helmeted warriors, fin-backed tyrannosaurs in various hues of rust
> and sulfurous yellow, painted with lichens—until they came again to the order
> and sanity of the forest, the scented pines, the slim and virginal aspens, and
> grassy fields glowing with silverleaf lupine, larkspur, scarlet pentstemon,
> where small butterflies with yellow wings, like flying flowers, danced in the
> air and sunlight.

### _The Monkey Wrench Gang_, 1975

#### Into the Heat: The Chase Continues

> Although the canyon walls are hundreds of feet high and often overhanging,
> there is little shade. Too dry for cottonwood. The only plant growth in sight
> is a clump of datura with wilted blooms, a dead pinyon pine, some snakeweed,
> and lichens on the rock.
